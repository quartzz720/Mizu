 * reason it was split out in the first place: a text buffer is where the
 * off-by-ones live and two copies written a week apart do not stay the same
 * shape.
 *
 * The style is the whole document's, which is not a shortcut - it is what
 * Notepad did, and for the same reason. A style that varies inside the text
 * needs a second buffer running alongside it saying where each run begins and
 * ends, and a plain text file has nowhere to keep that. The moment there is a
 * format that can, this becomes MizuWriter and the runs go in it.

 * The bar is the whole point and it was impossible yesterday. The mixer walks
 * a sound in 32.32 fixed point so that a recording made at one rate can play
 * at another, and the whole part of that number is how far in it has got - it
 * always knew, and nothing had ever asked. Three calls later there is a
 * position, a length and a seek, and a progress bar is arithmetic.
 *
 * The samples stay in memory for as long as the sound plays, because the mixer
 * reads them where they are rather than copying them. Freeing the buffer while
 * a voice still points into it is the one way to make this crash, so the
 * buffer is freed when the voice is stopped and never before.

 * streaming: nothing in the audio interface can ask a program for more samples
 * partway through, and inventing that is a bigger change than a player.
 *
 * So the limit is memory, and it used to be a made-up four megabytes - which
 * at CD rates is twenty-three seconds, and is the sort of number that gets
 * written once and then quietly decides what the software is for. SYS_ALLOC
