#ifndef SYSCALL_H
#define SYSCALL_H

/* The Koi-DOS system call interface.
 *
 * Shared verbatim between the kernel and the programs it runs, so that the two
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Calls are made with a software interrupt, the way INT 21h worked in DOS. The
 * vector is 0x40 rather than 0x21 because in protected mode 0x21 is taken: the
 * 8259s are remapped to vectors 32-47, which puts the keyboard IRQ exactly
 * there. DOS never had that collision - it lived in real mode.
 *
 * A software interrupt rather than SYSCALL/SYSRET is deliberate. Koi-DOS is a
 * ring-0 monolith, and the whole value of SYSRET is a fast ring 3 to ring 0
 * transition that does not happen here. INT costs three MSRs less setup and
 * gives an ABI that does not depend on where the kernel is linked.
 *
 * Convention:
 *   RAX  function number
 *   RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX  arguments, in that order
 *   RAX  return value
 *
 * Every other register is preserved - which the stub now actually does. It did
 * not always: the dispatcher is a C function and may clobber RCX, RDX, RSI,
 * RDI and R8-R11, and none of them were being saved. Nothing noticed until a
 * program compiled at -O2 kept a loop pointer in R8 across a call.
 */
#define SYSCALL_VECTOR 0x40

/* Major in the high byte, minor in the low one. Reported by SYS_VERSION and
   printed by `ver`.
 *
 * 0.51 rather than 0.6: the jump from 0.5 is not a jump in what the system is,
 * it is the point at which it stopped needing a USB stick to be changed. A
 * machine that updates itself over the network is a different thing to live
 * with than one that does not, and that is what beta means here. */
#define KOI_DOS_VERSION 0x0033

/* The interface's own version, which moves independently of the system's.
 *
 * A program records the version it was built against, and the kernel refuses
 * to start one it cannot honour. That check runs in both directions, and the
 * second one is the surprising half:
 *
 *   - A program built for a NEWER interface would call functions this kernel
 *     does not have. Obvious, and the usual worry.
 *   - A program built for an OLDER interface is refused too, while the
 *     interface is still ALPHA - because function numbers may have been
 *     reused since, and a program calling a number that has changed meaning
 *     does not fail. It does the wrong thing, silently, which is far worse
 *     than not starting.
 *
 * KOI_ABI_MINIMUM is what makes that a decision rather than a rule. It equals
 * KOI_ABI_VERSION for now; the day the numbering is frozen it stops moving,
 * and every program built from that day on keeps working forever.
 *
 * ONCE THE INTERFACE IS FROZEN, FUNCTION NUMBERS ARE NEVER REUSED. A removed
 * call leaves a hole. This is the promise that makes old programs safe, and it
 * costs nothing to keep - there are 256 numbers and twenty are in use. */
/* 9 adds the pointer (SYS_MOUSE, SYS_MOUSE_PLACE) and takes nothing away.
 *
 * The minimum stays at 8 for the first time, which is a decision rather than an
 * oversight. The rule above exists because a REUSED function number does the
 * wrong thing silently; 9 reuses none - it only fills two of the holes. And the
 * cost of moving the minimum is now real: a system update ships the kernel and
 * nothing else, so raising it would refuse every program already installed on a
 * machine until each was reinstalled. A rule worth keeping is worth keeping for
 * its reason, and the reason does not apply here. */

 * goes to COM1, is kept in memory for `log`, and is written to a file at boot.
 * Not a log of its own: two logs of the same run have to be interleaved by
 * hand afterwards, by somebody guessing at the order, and the whole value of a
 * log is that it already knows the order.
 *
 * SYS_LOG_BYTES is the one that matters. Everything a program can say about
 * itself is what it believed; this is what is actually there. Diagnosing the
 * lost-files bug meant carrying the disk to another machine and taking it
 * apart there, because nothing on the machine that failed could show a sector.
 *
 * SYS_SECTOR_READ is read-only and cannot damage anything. It grants no power
 * a program did not have - programs run in ring 0 and can already touch any
 * memory in the machine - it makes an existing capability usable on purpose
 * rather than by accident. There is deliberately no write counterpart. */

 * is what DOS's EXEC did and what SYS_CHAIN was standing in for while the
 * machine could hold one image at a time.
 *
 * SYS_CHAIN is still here and still means something different: chaining gives
 * up this program's memory before the next one starts, which is the only way
 * to run something that needs more of the window than is left. Running keeps
 * it. A shell that wants to come back where it was wants this one.
 *
 * The screen belongs to whoever took it. A program holding the framebuffer
 * should give it back before calling this and take it again afterwards -
 * nothing here does that for it, because a program that only wants to run
 * `dir` should not have its window torn down. */
